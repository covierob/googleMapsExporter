Export 3D Map as FBX for your Unity Scene

This Unity project should already include everything you need to export a 3D model of any region in the world as an FBX with every single house and road-part saved in it as a unity gameObject.

For this project I've used this Hands-on Quickstart guide by Google Maps Platform: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/gaming/quick_start
